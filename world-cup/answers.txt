Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

10 simulations was too small of an N because it returned very different predictions than simulations of larger N vaues

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 100000 simulations. The running time at 1000000 simulations was significantly longer than 100000 simulations, so the fee would be larger without a proportionate increase in prediction accuracy
